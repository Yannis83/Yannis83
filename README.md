## 🔍 About Me

I'm a seasoned finance professional with deep expertise in accounting (LuxGAAP, US GAAP, IFRS), financial reporting, and investment analysis — now actively building real-time AI agents for financial markets.

My vision: to build and deploy intelligent stock agents that combine algorithmic strategies, real-time data feeds, and financial domain expertise. I aim to integrate large language models (LLMs) with quantitative logic to create autonomous trading systems for predictive execution and portfolio optimization.
